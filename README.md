# code_challenges

This is a collection of code challenges I wrote while a student at Turing School of Software and Design. 
(http://turing.io) I collected these from the internet and wrote tests to aid students in learning solutions to interesting problems
and to practice their TDD skills. 

They are divided by category and each folder has an associated README.md file with further instructions.

They are what I consider noteware. If you use it, or like it, drop me a note and let me know! michael.dao@gmail.com
